    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dive into the ultimate comfort food with our <b>Classic Mac and Cheese</b>.
        This creamy, dreamy dish is a nostalgic favorite that combines
        tender elbow macaroni with a rich, velvety cheese sauce.</p>
    <p>We start with perfectly cooked pasta, enveloped in a luscious blend of
        sharp cheddar, smooth mozzarella, and a touch of tangy Parmesan.
        The sauce is seasoned to perfection with a hint of mustard powder,
        garlic, and a dash of paprika for added depth. Topped with a buttery,
        golden crust, this mac and cheese is baked until bubbling 
        and irresistibly gooey.</p>  
    <p>Whether you're looking for a hearty side or a satisfying main dish, 
        this recipe promises to deliver <em>warmth and 
            comfort</em> in every bite. Serve it up for a family dinner, a cozy night
        in, or any occasion that calls for a taste of home.</p>
